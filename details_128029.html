       <h4>Description:</h4> 
        <p>A Thousand Splendid Suns is a breathtaking story set against the volatile events of Afghanistan's last thirty years from the Soviet invasion to the reign of the Taliban to post-Taliban rebuilding�that puts the violence, fear, hope, and faith of this country in intimate, human terms. It is a tale of two generations of characters brought jarringly together by the tragic sweep of war, where personal lives�the struggle to survive, raise a family, find happiness�are inextricable from the history playing out around them.</i>        Propelled by the same storytelling instinct that made The Kite Runner a beloved classic, A Thousand Splendid Suns is at once a remarkable chronicle of three decades of Afghan history and a deeply moving account of family and friendship. It is
        a striking, heart-wrenching novel of an unforgiving time, an unlikely friendship, and an indestructible love a stunning accomplishment.</p>
