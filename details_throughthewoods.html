        <p> John euro, Canada. Goosebumps. Full of them. Reading this horror filled graphic novel during night-time turned out to be a terrifying idea. Yet, I couldn't stop reading. It was captivating. I don't think I've even noted a single thing of my environment
            while reading it; there was only the book and I. 8 likes 4 other comments
