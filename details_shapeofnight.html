        <h1> The Shape of Night by Tess Gerritsen (Goodreads Author) Rating details : 1,957 ratings 583 reviews</h1>


        Description:<br> A woman trying to outrun her past is drawn to a quiet coastal town in Maine and to a string of unsolved murders in this haunting tale of romantic suspense from New York Times bestselling author Tess Gerritsen. Ava Collette is
        punishing herself for an unspeakable tragedy. So she flees Boston and rents an old home named Brodie's Watch on a remote coastal peninsula of Maine, hoping to work on a cookbook inspired by New England cuisine that she's been trying to finish
        for months. She immediately feels at peace in the isolated house until she starts to hear strange noises. Rumor has it that a sea captain named Brodie has haunted the house for decades. Then, one night, Ava is awakened to find herself face to
        face with an apparition who looks and feels all too real. Meanwhile, there's been a series of accidental deaths nearby that don't add up. And as Ava starts to check into the previous renter's mysterious disappearance, she starts to realize that
        there's a disturbing secret some in town are desperate to keep hidden. Soon all of Ava's waking hours are consumed by her investigation, and her nights are ignited by Captain Brodie's ghostly visits. But even as she questions her own sanity, she
        knows she must uncover the truth before a killer strikes again.

    <p>lady leona, maryland I enjoyed Gerritsen's prior series, Rizzoli and Isles, so I was willing to give this standalone a try. Now, I'll be the first to admit that paranormal, gothic mysteries are not my normal cup of tea but I need to step outside my
        favorites every now and then.
