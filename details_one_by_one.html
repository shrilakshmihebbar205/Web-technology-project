        Description:<br> The Easton family has just moved into their new fixer-upper, a beautiful old house that they bought at a steal, and Alice, the youngest of the family, is excited to explore the strange, new place. Her excitement turns to growing
        dread as she discovers a picture hidden under the old wallpaper, a child�s drawing of a family just like hers. Soon after, members of the family begin to disappear, each victim marked on the child�s drawing with a dark black X. It�s up to her
        to unlock the grim mystery of the house before she becomes the next victim.
