        <h1>
            Resurection girls by Ava Morgyn (Goodreads Author) Rating details 193 ratings 142 reviews</h1>

        Description:<br> Olivia Foster hasn't felt alive since her little brother drowned in the backyard pool three years ago. Then Kara Hallas moves in across the street with her mother and grandmother, and Olivia is immediately drawn to these three
        generations of women. Kara is particularly intoxicating, so much so that Olivia not only comes to accept Kara's morbid habit of writing to men on death row, she helps her do it. They sign their letters as the Resurrection Girls. But as Kara's
        friendship pulls Olivia out of the dark fog she's been living in, Olivia realizes that a different kind of darkness taints the otherwise lively Hallas womenï¿½an impulse that is strange, magical, and possibly deadly.

        <b>Reviews and Popular answers</b> Magical realism mixed with grief and a dose of darkness, but ultimately not the read for me.
