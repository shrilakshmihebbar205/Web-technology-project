                <i>This is the way the world ends: with a nanosecond of computer error in a Defense Department laboratory and a million casual contacts that form the links in a chain letter of death. And here is the bleak new world of the day after: a world stripped of its institutions and emptied of 99 percent of its people. A world in which a handful of panicky survivors choose sides -- or are chosen. 


                    Andrew Horton The uncut is unbelievably bloated; it's probably the single greatest argument for a good editor in publishing history.

                <i>Does this book age well? I have a hard time reading books, specifically Sci-Fi books, that were written before the advent of most of our common technologies today. Are the references to the things/technologies that support this story still believable in today's time?

                      <p>Chris Pestacchi It's about the breakdown and rebirth of civilization; technology becomes irrelevant almost immediately in the book.</i>
