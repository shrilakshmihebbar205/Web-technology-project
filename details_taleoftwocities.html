        <h1> A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens, Richard Maxwell (Editor/Introduction) Rating details: 759,286 ratings 15,851 reviews</h1>
        <b>'Liberty, equality, fraternity, or death; -- the last, much the easiest to bestow, O Guillotine!'</b> Description:
        <br> After eighteen years as a political prisoner in the Bastille, the ageing Doctor Manette is finally released and reunited with his daughter in England. There the lives of two very different men, Charles Darnay, an exiled French aristocrat,
        and Sydney Carton, a disreputable but brilliant English lawyer, become enmeshed through their love for Lucie Manette. From the tranquil roads of London, they are drawn against their will to the vengeful, bloodstained streets of Paris at the height
        of the Reign of Terror, and they soon fall under the lethal shadow of La Guillotine. This edition uses the text as it appeared in its serial publication in 1859 to convey the full scope of Dickens's vision, and includes the original illustrations
        by H. K. Browne ('Phiz'). Richard Maxwell's introduction discusses the intricate interweaving of epic drama with personal tragedy.

    <b>Reviews and Popular Answered Questions</b>b> sara, california. Zaphirenia Very highly recommended. Even though I read it as a child, I remember very clearly the impact that left on me. Dickens is one of the greatest writers of all time and this
    is certainly a great book. 2 Likes 5 Years Ago

    <br> celone, russia Theodosia of the Fathomless Hall It's utterly bamboozling in the initial couple of pages, as the writing style is highly antiquated. . . not to mention Dickens always is a bit obfuscating, but is marvelous. The command of drama
    and the language is chilling. Overall, I'd definitely recommend it!! 3 Likes 5 other comments
