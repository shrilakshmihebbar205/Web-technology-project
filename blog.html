                <h3>The best books of 2019</h3>
                <h4>Erin Kodicek on November 12, 2019  </h4>
               <p>When we reflect on the books that resonated most this past year, usually a trend emerges. But 2019 bucked the trend, turning out a wide variety of gems to satisfy readers of all stripes.
                One of the stand-out literary stories of the year, however, was the highly-anticipated sequel to a modern dystopian classic. 
               Would Margaret Atwood's The Testaments, the follow-up to 1985's The Handmaid's Tale, live up to the hype? It absolutely does, topping our list, 
               and besting stiff competition from the likes of Colson Whitehead, Salman Rushdie, Erin Morgenstern, and many more. Atwood has said that this tale of hope and courage narrated
                by three strong female voices appears to have connected to this crucial 2019 moment. We couldn't agree more.</p>
               <br>
              <p> Crowning our list in the kids' category is Dear Sweet Pea by Julie Murphy, her middle-grade debut about Patricia Sweet Pea DiMarco, a seventh grader grappling with a 
               myriad of emotions and change, including recently divorced parents and friendships in transition. Dear Sweet Pea is a warmhearted read that is at once reassuring, wise, 
               and utterly relatable.</p>
               <br>
               <p>Below you'll find our top  picks for the best books of 2019. </p>

         <td>    <p>Praise be! After almost 35 years, Margaret Atwood released the sequel to her pioneering work of speculative fiction,
                The Handmaid's Tale, and it is well worth the wait. While The Handmaid's Tale explored how totalitarian regimes come to power,
                The Testaments delves into how they begin to fracture. At 80 years young, Atwood is at the top of her game. -Erin Kodicek</p>

                                two young black men sent to the infamous Nickel Academy in Florida. Set during the 1960s Jim Crow era, the story follows Elwood and Turner who, 
                                despite different backgrounds and world views, learn to lean on one another to survive. -Chris Schluep</p>

               <h3>Weekend reading</h3> 
                <h4>Chris Schluep on November 08, 2019</h4>
               <p>This weekend, the common theme among the books is reading is change. That's probably appropriate during these autumnal days when the leaves are falling.
                (I hear snow is falling somewhere across the country, too-yikes.) The end of daylight saving time, which brings early darkness, reminds us, too, that things change.
               <br>
               So we are taking home books about changes in our habits, in our bodies, and in our eating. There's a book about coming of age (in the shadow of celebrity no less),
                and even a book about changes in the geography of genius. There is also a book set in Manhattan's Chinatown, which doesn't fit neatly into the change theme. No matter. I have made 
               my bed and I will sleep in it. So cue the David Bowie song. Turn and face the strange. Or the falling leaves. Or the snow. Or the early evening darkness. And remember that a good book is
                a good way to center yourself during all this change. Even if the book you are reading is about change.
               so here are two books which i would like to appreciate and recommend everyone to have a look at.</p>

               <h3>Long Way Home by Cameron Douglas</h3>

    </td>

    <td>
            <p>I'd wanted to read Cameron Douglas memoir, Long Way Home when it first released but then I saw that there is an audible edition and Douglas reads it himself. 
                    It' is totally insane. And so hard to stop listening to. Douglas voice is unique, it has almost a surfer/stoner inflection but with excellent diction. And he lays his life out in full.
                     The good (which mostly comes later) and a whole lot of bad and ugly. He never tries to sugarcoat his behavior and he offers up some pretty vulnerable feelings and realizations about
                     himself. His drug addiction and subsequent YEARS in prison are a serious cautionary tale he ends up doing approximately six years in prison, and that's having both a father and
                     grandfather who are wealthy, marquee name celebrities. Think about that one for a minute. I've thus far found myself very taken with Douglas' story and his kind of quirky writing style. 
                    I've loved the insider perspective and detail of the various worlds he inhabited from East Coast boarding school to the international DJ scene, to prison life and I'm looking 
                    forward to see what is happening in his life at the point at which he wraps up his journey in the book. -Seira Wilson

                    <p>I've heard about this book from a few people in my life recently. And I dont know if my electric blanket is turned up too high or if the Change
                            is upon me, but this weekend while the leaves are turning colors and were planting tulip bulbs in preparation for spring blooms seems like an excellent time to dig into this
                            whole menopause thing. Ask me on Monday what I learned, because the one thing I know already is that by not talking about menopause, we keep it in the shadows and prolong 
                           our ignorance. High-fives to the ladies in my life who are already talking about it. -Adrian Liang

        <h3>Celebrity picks: <br>Erin Morgenstern's favorite recent reads</h3>
 <h4>Chris Schluep on November 04, 2019</h4>
 <table class="a7" cellpadding="40">
        <tr>
           
<td>
        <p>Erin Morgenstern became one of the more memorable authors to appear this decade when The Night Circus was published in 2011. The Night Circus was a mesmerizing, 
                fantastical read that quickly became a best seller. And it was a debut novel, which thrilled audiences and left a lot of readers waiting for another book from a favorite new author.
                That wait is finally over. Morgenstern's second novel, The Starless Sea, is set in a world as iconic and memorable as the one readers encountered in her first novel. 
                In this new book, readers will discover a secret underground world a place of pirates, painters, lovers, liars, and ships that sail upon a starless sea. And, as Amazon 
                Senior Editor Seira Wilson tells it, the novel "is a love letter to books and readers, a masterpiece of stories within a story." She goes on to explains that our protagonist, 
                Zachary Ezra Rawlins, "falls in love first with a book and later a person, both of which compel him to embark on a dangerous journey through time and place, lost loves,
                 and lives lived again and again."
                Where does an author as talented as Morgenstern turn when she wants to read a book? Find out below. </p>

        <p>Steel Crow Saga was already on my radar when my friend Chuck Wendig recommended it and happened
                to mention that it was a standalone. The word standalone is like catnip for me, because I don't always have the patience for series 
               and I love a self-contained fantasy. But I would happily spend more time in this incredibly vivid, masterfully drawn world. 
               I burst into tears when I finished reading, just because the story was over.

        <p>I haven't fallen into a book the way I fell into The Unwilling in years. I fell in deep and didn't have any desire to come back out again. 
                I was already a Kelly Braffet fan, so I was incredibly curious to see what she would do with a fantastical narrative, and this book exceeded my wildest expectations.
                 I keep thinking about the world and the characters even weeks after reading, and I am certain that I will return to it again and again and again.
