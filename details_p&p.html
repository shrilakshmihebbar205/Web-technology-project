          <h1>  Pride and Prejudice
            by Jane Austen, Anna Quindlen (Introduction)</h1>
            Description:<br>
            Since its immediate success in 1813, Pride and Prejudice has remained one of the most popular novels in the English language.
            Jane Austen called this brilliant work "her own darling child" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print."
            The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. 
            And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.

           <p> A:Thomas Do you have a phone, Kindle, tablet, or anything that can read eBooks? I would recommend reading Pride and Prejudice as an eBook, because most eReaders/eReader apps come with an inbuilt dictionary. 
             I think that being able to look up words and phrases immediately helped me to enjoy Pride and Prejudice
            and understand it well, unlike most of my classmates, who ended up hating it because they were frustrated with the writing. I'm 14 years old and I read it this year so age shouldn't be a problem.
            As weird as this method sounds, it really worked and for me, has made reading classics fun rather than a chore. Pride and Prejudice is (legally) free to download as an eBook, so why not give it a try?
             Whatever you choose to do, I hope that you enjoy Pride and Prejudice; it's such a great book :)</p>
