        recent demonic uprising, he realizes that the redemption he seeks can only come with a price. Torn between his self-sworn mission to protect humanity and his desire to rid himself of his curse, he stumbles across the legend of a demon, a trickster
        who claims they can cure vampirisim and restore his humanity for a small cost: a sacrifice...a Slayer. Written by Bryan Hill (Detective Comics, Hulu's Titans) with art from Gleb Melnikov. Discover a brand new, modern take on one of the best and

    <p>An OK start to the Angel reboot. The villain in the first arc is pretty lame. Internet demons are never going to be interesting or threatening. I like the idea of bringing in Angel's Scooby gang from the very beginning even if they are being revamped,
        at least Fred and Gun are coming back. I do hope they don't leave Angel in Sunnydale for long. That would make it too difficult to give each book its own identity.</p>
